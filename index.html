<h1> My Interests </h1>

<p>I am interested in how populations adapt to shifting environmental conditions. I am particularly drawn to parasites, invasive species, and other species we perceive as disruptive.  <br>
  <br>
I have worked with a variety of species, including salmon, Tanner crab, blue king crab, European green crab, cod, and herring. <br>
  <br>
I am a proponent for open science. I use an <a href="https://afcoyle.github.io/notebook/">open access online lab notebook</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/afcoyle">GitHub</a> to share my research and support reproducibility. <br>
  <br>
I am currently a graduate student with <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/">Dr. Steven Roberts</a> in the <a href="https://fish.uw.edu/">School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences</a> at the University of Washington. <br>

<h1> Current Research </h1>

<h4> Bitter Crab Disease (Hematodinium) in Alaskan snow & Tanner crab </h4>

<p><i>How do temperature shifts affect the parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium?</i><br>
  <br>
<i> Hematodinium </i> is a parasitic dinoflagellate that infects over 40 crab species worldwide. It poses a threat to Alaska's valuable snow and Tanner crab fisheries for two reasons - it is thought to be fatal, and it turns the crab meat bitter and unmarketable. Previous studies have found a link between <i> Hematodinium</i> prevalence and warming waters. By uncovering how <i> Hematodinium</i> responds to climate change conditions, we can understand what the future holds for these fisheries and adapt accordingly <br>
