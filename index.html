<h1> My Interests </h1>

<p> I have worked with all sorts of marine invertebrates from cephalopods, to echinoderms to mollusks. I consider myself an Environmental Biologist with a focus in marine invertebrates. 
  <br>
  <br>
I have worked at various Marine Labs both on the East and West Coasts <br>

<ul>
<li>Univeristy of Chicago, 2014-2018</li>
<li>Marine Biological Laboratory, 2016</li>
<li>Puget Sound Restoration Fund, 2018-2020</li>
<li> Pacific Hybreed, 2019-2020</li>
<li> Hood Canal Mariculture, 2020-2021</li>
<li> University of Washington, 2021-present</li>
</ul>
  <br>
I am a proponent for open science. I use an <a href="https://ocattau.github.io/notebook-2/">open access online lab notebook</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/ocattau">GitHub</a> to share my research and support reproducibility. <br>
  <br>
I am currently a graduate student with <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/">Dr. Steven Roberts</a> in the <a href="https://fish.uw.edu/">School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences</a> at the University of Washington. <br>

<h1> Current Research </h1>

<h4> Citrate Synthase </h4>

<p><i>How are Pacific Oysters (C. gigas) responding to multiple stressors and how can we measure stress? </i><br>
  <br>
<i> Citrate Synthase </i> is an enzyme that determines the rate of the Krebs Cycle are can be used as a proxie for quantifiing intact mitochondria <i> Multiple-Stress </i> Oysters are stressed by increasingly high air and water temperatures but also polyploidy stress which is a type of stress due to the induction of a third chromosome (3n) that is a factor in <i> in situ </i> mass mortality events <br>
</p>

<h5> Geoduck Larval Transcriptome Analysis </h5>
<p><i> How can we compare the transcriptomes of multiple tissue types and life stages to better understand geoduck development? </i><br>
 <br>
 notes here <br>
</p>

<h5> Moledular Delivery of Morpholinos or CRISPR Cas9 system into shellfish embryos </h5>

<p><i> How to deliver a gene editing system into early life stages of geoduck (P. generosa) and/or pacific oysters (C. gigas) </i><br>
<br>
 Lots of work on this effort to visualize a phenotype change in early life stages (48 hours post fertilization. See the first post in this series [here](https://ocattau.github.io/notebook-2/2022-08-20-moleculardelivery/) or look for tag 'oysters'<br>
