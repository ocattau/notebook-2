# Updated R studio script to make it more reproducable and in plain english

1. set new protein curve using only linear portions of the curve
2. averaged technical replicates for each oyster
3. set universal protein and CS curve for easy analysis
4. checked background wells for autoflourescence (not significant)

# Results

1. updated regression analysis to include D-desiccation to the significant list in addition to T-desiccation
2. overall reduced total CS values
