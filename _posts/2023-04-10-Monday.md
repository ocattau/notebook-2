# geoduck transcriptome 

## go slims w/ better transctiptome

- added goslims to genome linked p. generosa transcriptome

- loaded goslim mapping from Swiss Prott
[link here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/code/tree/master/r_projects/sam/20230328-pgen-gene_annotation-update) 

- final new table 
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocattau/code-for-Pgenerosa/main/output/pgenerosa_transcriptome_goslims_20230410.csv)

## adding in new clam species 

- Downloaded top 6 clam species transcriptomes

- Manilla Clam -- genome only []()
- Mercineria Mercineria -- only one with full information 
Title:Mercenaria mercenaria GCF_021730395.1-RS_2023_01 proteins
Description:The collection of Reference Sequence (RefSeq) proteins annotated on the set of genomic RefSeqs included in a specific annotation run. This collection includes both curated RefSeq proteins that have been placed on the genome and model proteins predicted by NCBI's genome annotation pipeline. The model proteins are derived from the genome sequence and have varying levels of transcript or protein homology support.
