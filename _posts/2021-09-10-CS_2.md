## CS Test #2 ##
Ran the sample curve, background control and positive control for the CS kit on the spec in FTR. At 405um instead of 412um, the sample curve was uneffected by the slight change in wavelength. Monday I will run another test with oyster tissue to test the enzyme at 25C with the old machine.
