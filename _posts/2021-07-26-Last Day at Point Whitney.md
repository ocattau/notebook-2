# End of an ERA
## Today was the last day (Monday July 26th 2021) at Point Whitney working with Matt George (mngeorge@uw.edu) on oyster disections for his pacific oyster triploid temperature stress experiment. 

### My next goal will be to write the procedure and procure supplies for the citrate-synthase assay for this project and my next project on fish breeding
